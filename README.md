Heros of the Empire - Unity3d Mobile Game

Git LFS is required for this project. Download it at https://git-lfs.github.com/ .  Make sure it's downloaded and installed prior to cloning this repo.

It doesn't appear to be possible to merge unity project conflicts because they are stored as blobs.  We have metadata files enabled which allows git to track changes to the project, but the merges are unreadable.  This means that we can't really work on project files concurrently.  If you have a merge conflict, create a new branch and manually re-apply your changes on top of the latest.
